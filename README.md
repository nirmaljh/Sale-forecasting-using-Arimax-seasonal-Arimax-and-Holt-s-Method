ARIMAX and SARIMAX are advanced techniques used in time series forecasting, particularly for analyzing sales data like Perrin Freres monthly champagne sales. These models enhance traditional ARIMA or seasonal ARIMA methods by incorporating external factors, known as exogenous variables, that could influence the sales patterns.

In the case of Perrin Freres champagne sales, ARIMAX combines ARIMA modeling with additional variables like marketing efforts or economic indicators. These external factors, not part of the inherent sales pattern, are integrated into the forecasting process. For instance, if a marketing campaign affects sales, ARIMAX considers historical sales, autoregressive and moving average elements, integration for non-stationarity, and the exogenous variable's impact.

SARIMAX takes this approach a step further by considering seasonality. Since champagne sales might vary with holidays or special occasions, SARIMAX accounts for both seasonality and exogenous variables. In addition to ARIMA elements, SARIMAX includes seasonal autoregressive and moving average components.

In summary, ARIMAX and SARIMAX techniques improve sales forecasting by incorporating external factors. ARIMAX integrates these variables into ARIMA, while SARIMAX expands the integration to address seasonal patterns. For Perrin Freres champagne sales, these models yield more precise forecasts by considering both inherent sales trends and external influences.
